# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **`release-supply-chain.yml` optional `runtime_paths`.** When set, the
  workflow builds a second deterministic, minimal runtime bundle from the
  selected tracked paths (reproducible tar assembled from Git blobs; executable
  bits preserved; symlinks and non-regular entries rejected), includes it in
  the release manifest, `SHA256SUMS`, and the single immutable release-create
  call, and attests its build provenance alongside the source archive. Empty
  (default) leaves every existing asset, checksum, and attestation
  byte-for-byte unchanged, so current callers are unaffected. (RVR-P3-001)

### Fixed

- **`monorepo-changed-paths` rejects `pull_request_target`.** Under that
  privileged event GitHub checks out the base branch rather than the PR, so
  the git-diff router saw none of the proposed changes and returned a green
  all-false — silently skipping every gated test, scan, build, or migration.
  The router now hard-fails on `pull_request_target` (before any base
  resolution, and regardless of an explicit `base_ref`) with a message
  pointing callers to `pull_request`; checking out fork code to work around
  it is unsafe and intentionally not offered. `check_monorepo_routing.py`
  gains negative fixtures proving both the payload-base and explicit-base
  forms fail closed. (RVR-P2-005)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- `release-supply-chain-free.yml`: the identical closed release pipeline
  (deterministic tracked-source archive, exact-payload SPDX SBOM, canonical
  release notes, manifest, `SHA256SUMS`, one-shot immutable publish) without
  the GitHub attestation steps, requesting only `contents: write`. Its
  manifest records `slsa_build_level: null`. Copy-paste caller:
  `examples/release/private-free-release.yml`.
- Tracked agent instruction docs `AGENTS.md` (Codex-native) and
  `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code-native), plus `.DS_Store` in `.gitignore`.

### Changed

- This repository's own release archive now includes `AGENTS.md` and
  `.claude/CLAUDE.md` alongside the other tracked contributor docs, so the
  published source archive is the complete library surface.

- `actionlint.yml` now states and enforces its real runner contract: the
  workflow installs the checksum-verified linux_amd64 binary, so a
  first-step guard rejects any runner that is not Linux X64 with a clear
  error before the download instead of failing halfway through install.
  `scripts/check_actionlint_contract.py` executes the guard against a
  supported/unsupported OS-architecture matrix via `validate_all`.
- **Breaking (`benchmark`):** the single dual-mode workflow is split into a
  publish lane and a read-only compare lane, because compare-only runs
  (`auto_push: false`) still granted `contents: write` and handed a
  write-capable `GITHUB_TOKEN` to the third-party benchmark action.
  `benchmark.yml` now always publishes history (`auto-push: true`,
  `contents: write`) and drops the `auto_push` input; `benchmark-compare.yml`
  is the new read-only lane (`contents: read`, `auto-push: false`) whose
  job-scoped token cannot write. `scripts/check_benchmark_contract.py` keeps
  the two lanes byte-parallel except for that single difference. Callers that
  passed `auto_push: false` switch to `benchmark-compare.yml`; callers on the
  default publish behavior keep `benchmark.yml` unchanged.
- **Breaking (`monorepo-changed-paths`):** the router is now fail-closed.
  `filters` is a strict JSON object of exact file paths or directory prefixes
  ending in `/`; wildcard patterns — previously matched via a
  boundary-crossing `startswith` heuristic, so `src*` also matched `src-old/`
  — now fail the run. An explicit `base_ref`, pull-request base, or
  `merge_group` base that cannot be resolved fails the run instead of
  silently reporting every group unchanged (the `git diff … || true`
  suppression is gone). Pull-request routing uses merge-base semantics,
  `merge_group` is handled as a first-class event, and a push without a
  usable previous tip (branch creation, force-push beyond reachable history)
  or any other event without `base_ref` conservatively reports every group
  as changed. `scripts/check_monorepo_routing.py` exercises the embedded
  program against a hermetic Git-DAG fixture matrix (invalid bases,
  zero/unreachable `before`, multi-commit pushes, prefix boundaries,
  renames, deletions, unusual filenames) via `validate_all`.

### Fixed

- Tier truth for GitHub Artifact Attestations: on the Free, Pro, and Team
  plans attestations are available to **public repositories only**; private
  and internal repositories require GitHub Enterprise Cloud (a plan gate that
  GHAS/Code Security does not unlock). `release-supply-chain.yml` therefore
  cannot complete on private Free/Pro/Team repositories — its unconditional
  attestation steps fail before the release is created. The catalog
  (`artifact-attestations`, `slsa-build-provenance`, `release-supply-chain`),
  README tier tables, and docs 01/02/03/07/09 now state the real plan
  boundary, and the private-free tier releases via
  `release-supply-chain-free.yml`. The release validator enforces byte-level
  step parity between the two variants (minus attestations), the free
  variant's `contents: write`-only permission set, and the absence of any
  attestation reference in the free variant.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-10

### Security

- Materialize canonical release notes inside the closed release directory before
  the manifest and checksums are generated. The immutable downloadable notes
  asset now preserves release-note integrity even though GitHub permits the
  release title and body to be edited after publication.
- Require changelog-derived and explicit notes to be tracked, regular,
  non-symlink UTF-8 files with non-whitespace content, and refuse a pre-existing
  canonical output path.

### Fixed

- Publish `release-notes.md` as the fifth explicit immutable asset, declare it in
  `release-manifest.json`, cover it with `SHA256SUMS`, and use that exact file as
  the GitHub Release body in the same single create call.
- Extend the embedded-program validator with positive and adversarial fixtures
  for canonical notes, missing or undeclared assets, exact five-asset publish
  arguments, and checksum closure.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-10

### Security

- Build source archives from a normalized, literal Git-index expansion of the
  caller's selected paths. Empty, unmatched, absolute, traversing,
  non-normalized, duplicate, option-like, control-character, dirty-worktree,
  symlink, submodule, and other non-regular Git entries now fail closed.
- Feed GNU tar a sorted NUL-delimited tracked-file list with verbatim option
  handling and recursion disabled. Untracked directory contents and tar/pathspec
  injection can no longer enter a release archive.
- Validate strict numeric SemVer before the untrusted input can reach checkout,
  then check out the exact requested tag and revalidate its LF-terminated
  one-line `VERSION`, optional tracked changelog heading, tag context, safe
  package basename, source tag object, and peeled commit identity.
- Run every embedded Python release guard with isolated mode (`python3 -I`) so
  caller-controlled `PYTHONPATH`, site customization, or standard-library
  shadow modules cannot hijack release logic.
- Replace `anchore/sbom-action` with a direct Syft 1.42.3 binary download whose
  Linux AMD64/ARM64 archive size and SHA-256 are pinned in the workflow. No
  mutable remote installer executes in the privileged release job.

### Fixed

- Generate changelog-derived release notes in runner temporary storage and
  publish an explicit four-item asset array. `release-notes.md` is no longer an
  undeclared fifth immutable release asset omitted from the manifest and
  checksums.
- Match changelog headings literally and require exactly one version section;
  dotted versions can no longer behave as regular expressions or select an
  ambiguous duplicate section.
- Build the archive before SBOM generation, extract that exact archive into a
  private runner-temporary payload, and scan only that payload. The SPDX SBOM
  can no longer describe caller files that are absent from the source archive.
- Generate `release-manifest.json` and `SHA256SUMS` from explicit asset names,
  require the final directory to equal the manifest closure, and reject
  symlinked or non-regular release assets.
- Revalidate the remote tag object immediately before publication and record
  both the source tag object and peeled source commit in the release manifest.

### Added

- Add a `validate_all.py` release-supply-chain gate that extracts and executes
  the workflow's exact embedded guards against positive and adversarial
  fixtures for archive selection, extracted-payload closure, strict versions,
  isolated Python, pinned Syft architecture selection, exact publish arguments,
  asset closure, manifest contents, and checksum coverage.

### Changed

- Make the library's own custom source archive complete: workflows, rulesets,
  catalog, generated and authored docs, examples, validators, locked validation
  dependencies, community files, and the root ignore boundary are all selected
  from the exact tag's tracked state.
- Remove the former `sbom_source_path` input. Syft now always scans the exact
  extracted archive payload, and release runners are explicitly limited to
  Linux X64/ARM64 because the deterministic archive contract requires GNU tar.

### Migration

- Update callers pinned to an older release before adopting `0.5.0`: remove
  `sbom_source_path`, ensure `VERSION` is one LF-terminated numeric SemVer line,
  use only normalized tracked regular-file selections in `archive_paths`, keep
  an explicit `notes_file` tracked and regular, and select a Linux X64/ARM64
  runner. These intentionally incompatible contract changes require a minor
  release rather than a patch release.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-10

### Security

- Remove the unsafe `enable_harden_runner` step toggle. Harden-Runner's
  JavaScript `pre` and `post` hooks can execute even when the main step's `if`
  condition is false, so cross-tier and private-free workflows now contain no
  StepSecurity action reference.
- Add a fail-closed validator that restricts Harden-Runner to explicit
  public/GHAS workflows, requires it to be unconditional and first in its job,
  and rejects regressions to the legacy toggle contract.
- Update the remaining public/GHAS Harden-Runner references to v2.20.0 at the
  audited full commit SHA.
- Compile the validator dependency set with complete distribution hashes and
  require hash verification in self-CI.

### Changed

- Make the public/GHAS versus private-free billing boundary structural rather
  than caller-configured. This is a breaking input-contract change for callers
  that passed `enable_harden_runner`; remove that input when updating the pin.
- Migrate the SBOM attestation from the deprecated `actions/attest-sbom` to
  `actions/attest` (native SBOM mode via `sbom-path`, an identical interface).
  The SPDX predicate type and `scripts/verify_attestations.sh` verification are
  unchanged.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- Language packs: Dart/Flutter, C/C++, Qt, Kotlin/Android, Swift, R, HTML/CSS,
  and SQL reusable workflows (joining Python, Node, Go, Rust, Java, .NET,
  container, and Terraform).
- Quality gates: `coverage-gate` (Codecov/Coveralls), `docs-quality`
  (lychee/typos/markdownlint), and `pr-hygiene`
  (commitlint/PR-title/labeler/stale).
- Free SAST/SCA/IaC for every tier including private-free: Semgrep OSS,
  OSV-Scanner, Grype, hadolint, and Checkov (all gate-only, no security-events).
- Advanced testing: `mutation-testing`, `fuzzing` (cargo-fuzz), and `benchmark`
  (github-action-benchmark regression alert).
- Level-3 opt-in caller examples: AI code review (Claude Code Action) and
  release automation (release-please).
- `docs/15-language-and-quality-packs.md` and `examples/` subdirectories
  (`languages/`, `quality/`, `security/`, `testing/`, `level3/`).

### Changed

- Catalog grows to 67 capabilities and 38 pinned tools; every new third-party
  action is SHA-pinned with a version comment and verified against its
  `action.yml` input contract.
- `terraform-ci` documents `terraform_version` pinning for reproducible CI.
- Generated docs re-dated to 2026-07-08.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Machine-readable catalog schema under `catalog/schema/`.
- Catalog-derived generated docs under `docs/generated/`, checked by
  `scripts/generate_docs.py --check` through `scripts/validate_all.py`.
- Example workflow validator for copy-paste caller snippets, including
  private-free least privilege and Scorecard trigger constraints.
- Markdown local-link and merge-queue compatibility validators.
- First-class July 2026 catalog entries for merge queue, step-level parallel
  execution, hosted-runner governance controls, RHEL larger-runner images,
  license-compliance preview, npm trusted publishing, and PyPI trusted
  publishing.
- npm/PyPI trusted-publishing examples and `scripts/export_repo_sbom.sh`.
- Review reconciliation document under `docs/audit/`.

### Changed

- Strengthened catalog validation for workflow/example coverage, source URLs,
  tool pin shape, duplicate IDs, and stale materialized-workflow risk text.
- Updated runners, Actions core, rulesets, releases/packages, supply-chain, and
  watchlist docs for July 2026 platform facts.
- Fixed SBOM attestation verification docs to verify the released artifact with
  the SPDX predicate type.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- `cross-platform-smoke.yml` now supports OS-specific command overrides
  (`linux_command`, `macos_command`, `windows_command`) while preserving the
  default `command` fallback.

### Changed

- `public-scorecard-json.yml` now defaults `publish_results` to `false`.
  Reusable workflow callers keep Scorecard as a JSON artifact/check signal by
  default, avoiding OpenSSF Scorecard webapp workflow-shape verification
  failures.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- `public-dependency-review.yml` now exposes `vulnerability_check` and
  `allow_licenses`, preserving stricter adapter-local Dependency Review
  semantics during migration to reusable workflows.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- `public-scorecard-json.yml` for Scorecard JSON artifact mode without
  `security-events: write`, matching estate policy where Scorecard is a
  project-health signal rather than a code-scanning alert source.
- Checkout controls (`checkout_ref`, `fetch_depth`, `submodules`) and setup hooks
  for `private-static.yml` and `cross-platform-smoke.yml`, so private/root
  callers can preserve PR refs and submodule validation.
- Adapter-migration extension inputs for shared workflows: `actionlint.yml`
  `post_command`, `secret-scan.yml` report/config/post-command options, and
  `public-codeql.yml` optional CodeQL config/autobuild/artifact output.

### Changed

- Public examples now default to `public-scorecard-json.yml`; SARIF Scorecard
  remains available through `public-scorecard.yml` for repositories that
  intentionally want code-scanning upload.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- **CI/CD encyclopedia** under `docs/` (17 pages): public-OSS / private-free /
  private-paid tiers, Actions core, runners, security scanning, supply chain
  (SLSA/SBOM/attestations), governance/rulesets, releases, deployments,
  observability, community DX, external tools, AI/agentic workflows, a 2026
  watchlist, and `pull_request_target` hardening.
- **Machine-readable catalog** under `catalog/` (`capabilities.yml`,
  `tools.yml`, `deprecations.yml`) with a uniform, validated schema.
- **Language / use-case reusable packs**: `python-ci.yml`, `node-ci.yml`,
  `go-ci.yml`, `rust-ci.yml`, `java-ci.yml`, `dotnet-ci.yml`,
  `container-ci.yml` (Trivy), `terraform-ci.yml`, `docs-ci.yml`, and
  `monorepo-changed-paths.yml`.
- **Rulesets-first governance** under `.github/rulesets/` (branch, tag, push)
  mirroring live protection, plus a migration guide.
- **Static validators** (`scripts/validate_all.py` and friends) enforcing
  full-SHA pins, least-privilege permissions/timeouts, the reusable-workflow
  contract, ruleset shape, and the catalog schema — wired into `ci.yml`.
- **Community health kit**: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  `SUPPORT.md`, a PR template, and issue forms.
- **Attestation verifier** `scripts/verify_attestations.sh`, plus `examples/`
  caller workflows for each tier and a `pip` Dependabot ecosystem.

### Changed

- **Release supply chain** now generates a real SPDX SBOM (Syft via
  `anchore/sbom-action`), attests the archive with
  `actions/attest-build-provenance` and the SBOM with `actions/attest-sbom`
  (SLSA v1.0 Build L3, produced inside the reusable workflow), and publishes an
  **immutable release in a single `gh release create`** call.
- **`zizmor.yml` split** into `zizmor-sarif.yml` (public / paid, uploads SARIF)
  and `zizmor-no-sarif.yml` (private-free, `contents: read` only — least
  privilege).
- **`ci.yml`** now runs `scripts/validate_all.py` as its contract gate.
- README rewritten around the three-tier positioning; SECURITY.md corrected.

### Removed

- `gh release upload --clobber` fallback: it fails against immutable releases
  (GA 2025-10-28). The workflow now fails fast if a release already exists.
- Combined `zizmor.yml` (replaced by the SARIF / no-SARIF split).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Initial reusable GitHub Actions CI/CD + supply-chain workflow library for the
  NDDev estate, split into two tiers.
- Public-only reusables (free on public repos): `public-codeql.yml`,
  `public-scorecard.yml`, `public-dependency-review.yml`.
- Dual-tier reusables (free on both; `enable_harden_runner`/`upload_sarif`
  toggles for the private free tier): `secret-scan.yml` (digest-pinned
  gitleaks), `actionlint.yml` (checksum-verified), `zizmor.yml`,
  `cross-platform-smoke.yml`, `release-supply-chain.yml`.
- Private free-minimal reusable: `private-static.yml`.
- Self-CI (`ci.yml`) dogfoods `actionlint` and `zizmor` on this repository and
  enforces a reusable-workflow contract; tag-driven `release.yml` publishes an
  attested SBOM/checksum bundle via `release-supply-chain.yml`.
- All third-party actions pinned to full commit SHAs; least-privilege
  `permissions`; concurrency and timeouts on every workflow.
