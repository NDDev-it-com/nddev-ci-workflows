# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report suspected vulnerabilities privately via GitHub Security Advisories:
https://github.com/NDDev-it-com/nddev-ci-workflows/security/advisories/new

Do not open public issues for security reports. You will receive an initial
response as soon as reasonably possible.

## Consuming these workflows securely

- **Always pin by full commit SHA**, never by tag or branch:
  `uses: NDDev-it-com/nddev-ci-workflows/.github/workflows/<name>.yml@<40-char-sha>`.
  Tags are mutable; a full SHA is immutable. Dependabot can bump the pinned SHA.
- Grant the calling job only the permissions the reusable declares it needs.
- Treat the private free tier (`enable_harden_runner: false`,
  `upload_sarif: false`) as the correct choice for private repositories, where
  code scanning, native secret scanning, and harden-runner are paid features.

## Posture of this repository

- Every third-party action is pinned to a full commit SHA with a version comment.
- Every workflow declares least-privilege `permissions`, `concurrency`, and a
  `timeout-minutes`.
- `ci.yml` runs `actionlint` and `zizmor` (pedantic) against this repository's
  own workflows on every push and pull request.
- `main` is protected: signed commits, required review + code-owner review,
  linear history, no force-push or deletion, and the `ci-gate` status check.
- Releases are tag-driven and ship an SPDX SBOM, SHA256SUMS, and SLSA build
  provenance attestations.
