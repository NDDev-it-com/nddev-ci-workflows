# Language & quality packs (July 2026 expansion)

This page documents the reusable packs added in the July 2026 expansion. Every
pack follows the library conventions (top-level `permissions: {}`, SHA-pinned
actions with version comments, env-indirected caller commands, `timeout-minutes`,
and an explicit private-free-safe action surface) and is validated by
`scripts/validate_all.py`. The
machine-readable source of truth is
[`catalog/capabilities.yml`](../catalog/capabilities.yml); the full matrix is in
[generated/capability-matrix.md](generated/capability-matrix.md).

Tier legend: **Public** = free on public repos; **Private-free** = free on
private repos (no paid GHAS); **Private-paid** = available with GHAS. Language
build packs consume metered runner minutes on private repos (marked
*conditional* in the catalog) but need no paid feature. They contain no
Harden-Runner reference, so private callers do not need a disable toggle.

## Language packs

Dual-tier, caller-command-driven with sensible defaults.

| Pack | Workflow | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dart/Flutter | `dart-flutter-ci.yml` | [dart-flutter](../examples/languages/dart-flutter.yml) |
| C/C++ | `cpp-ci.yml` | [cpp](../examples/languages/cpp.yml) |
| Qt | `qt-ci.yml` | [qt](../examples/languages/qt.yml) |
| Kotlin/Android | `kotlin-android-ci.yml` | [kotlin-android](../examples/languages/kotlin-android.yml) |
| Swift | `swift-ci.yml` | [swift](../examples/languages/swift.yml) |
| R | `r-ci.yml` | [r](../examples/languages/r.yml) |
| HTML/CSS/web | `web-ci.yml` | [web](../examples/languages/web.yml) |
| SQL | `sql-ci.yml` | [sql](../examples/languages/sql.yml) |

These join the existing Python, Node, Go, Rust, Java, .NET, container, and
Terraform packs. Swift defaults to a macOS runner (10x minute multiplier); its
SwiftLint step runs on macOS only.

The Go pack checks out one commit by default. Callers whose validation reads
Git ancestry or pull-request merge parents must set `fetch_depth: 0`; the
default remains `1` for backward compatibility and faster tree-only builds.

## Quality gates

| Pack | Workflow | Tiers | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coverage (Codecov/Coveralls) | `coverage-gate.yml` | all (token on private) | [coverage-gate](../examples/quality/coverage-gate.yml) |
| Docs quality (lychee/typos/markdownlint) | `docs-quality.yml` | free everywhere | [docs-quality](../examples/quality/docs-quality.yml) |
| PR hygiene (commitlint/PR-title/labeler/stale) | `pr-hygiene.yml` | free everywhere | [pr-hygiene](../examples/quality/pr-hygiene.yml) |

## Free security (SAST / SCA / IaC)

Free on **every** tier, including private-free where CodeQL and dependency review
are paid GHAS. All are gate-only (no SARIF upload, so no `security-events`
permission is required).

| Pack | Tool | Workflow | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SAST | Semgrep OSS | `semgrep-ci.yml` | [semgrep](../examples/security/semgrep.yml) |
| SCA | OSV-Scanner | `osv-scan.yml` | [osv-scan](../examples/security/osv-scan.yml) |
| SCA | Grype | `grype-scan.yml` | [grype-scan](../examples/security/grype-scan.yml) |
| Dockerfile | hadolint | `hadolint-ci.yml` | [hadolint](../examples/security/hadolint.yml) |
| IaC | Checkov | `iac-scan.yml` | [iac-scan](../examples/security/iac-scan.yml) |

## Advanced testing

| Pack | Workflow | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mutation testing (mutmut/cargo-mutants/Stryker) | `mutation-testing.yml` | [mutation-testing](../examples/testing/mutation-testing.yml) |
| Fuzzing (cargo-fuzz; ClusterFuzzLite noted) | `fuzzing.yml` | [fuzzing](../examples/testing/fuzzing.yml) |
| Benchmark + regression alert (history publish) | `benchmark.yml` | [benchmark](../examples/testing/benchmark.yml) |
| Benchmark regression check (read-only compare) | `benchmark-compare.yml` | [benchmark-compare](../examples/testing/benchmark-compare.yml) |

## Level-3 opt-in (self-contained examples)

Delivered as self-contained caller examples (no reusable workflow), since they
wrap fast-moving third-party services and are opt-in.

| Pattern | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI code review | [ai-review](../examples/level3/ai-review.yml) | Claude Code Action; CodeRabbit (free OSS) / Qodo alternatives. Advisory — human review stays the merge gate. |
| Release automation | [release-please](../examples/level3/release-please.yml) | Complements the tag-driven attested release; changesets for monorepos. |
