# Examples

Copy-paste caller workflows, grouped by tier. In every example, **replace
`@<sha>` with a pinned full 40-character commit SHA** of this repository (tags
are mutable; Dependabot bumps the SHA for you).

- [`public-oss/`](public-oss/) — full free security suite for public repos.
- [`private-free/`](private-free/) — zero-cost stack for private repos.
- [`private-paid-ghas/`](private-paid-ghas/) — GHAS-enabled private repos.

Use-case groups shared by every tier: [`languages/`](languages/),
[`quality/`](quality/), [`security/`](security/), [`testing/`](testing/),
[`infra/`](infra/), [`release/`](release/), and opt-in
[`level3/`](level3/) patterns.

A caller job **must grant every permission the reusable job declares**, or the
run fails at startup. See [`../docs/04-actions-core.md`](../docs/04-actions-core.md).
